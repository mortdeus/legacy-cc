=========

The earliest versions of the very first C compiler known to exist in the wild written by the late legend himself dmr. 

These are not capable of being compiled today with modern C compilers like gcc. I am only posting these here for the enjoyment and reminiscing of the spark that ignited a soon to be trillion dollar industry. Enjoy. :)   

You guys might be able to play around building this compilier with Aiju's pdp-11/unix emulator. I havent tried building this myself so I cant confirm it works, but I posted the link to his emulator for anybody wanting to hack around with it.
